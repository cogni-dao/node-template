# Session-start cognition loader — shared by the Claude Code (.claude/settings.json),
# Codex (.codex/config.toml) and OpenCode (.opencode/plugin) entry points, and by
# Conductor workspace setup. Delivers THIS node's own cognition bundle.
#
# Design: FRESH FIRST, BOUNDED, CACHE FALLBACK (story.0001). Every session start
# fetches the bundle from the node hub with a short timeout, so each session
# works from cognition acquired for it. When the hub is down or slow, the last
# complete cache this checkout fetched (.cogni/.cognition-cache.md) is
# presented instead, so a hub outage never costs a session its contract and the
# hub is not a fleet-wide boot dependency (bug.5122). Only a boot with no
# complete bundle surfaces a short, honest recovery notice that
# separates "no credentials yet" from a key-present failure.
#
# .env.cogni holds two accounts (see .env.cogni.example): the NODE account
# (this node's own hub — the bearer used here) and the OPERATOR account
# (cognidao.org — CI/CD only: flight, deploy, secrets; never used by this loader).

No COGNI_NODE_API_KEY was found, so this session could not load its cognition
bundle from:
  $URL

This is a setup step, not an outage. To bootstrap:
- register a NODE agent via /api/v1/agent/register
- save COGNI_NODE_API_KEY in the clone-root .env.cogni
- for Codex, review and trust the repo's SessionStart hook via /hooks

Then restart or resume the agent.

COGNI COGNITION — could not load bundle (no complete cache)

A credential IS present, so this is NOT a missing-key setup problem. Either the
hub is down/slow, or the key lacks a principal on this hub (or the node has no
cognition published yet), and this checkout has no complete cached bundle.

Check hub health and that GET $URL resolves with your key. Stay in bootstrap
recovery (AGENTS.md) until it loads, then restart or resume the agent.
