/**
 * Module: `@cogni-dao/money-plane/types`
 * Purpose: The one row model every money-plane reader returns and every node renders, plus the reader port.
 * Scope: Types only. Does not read, grade, or render anything.
 * Invariants: ONE_ROW_MODEL — a per-row Pay button is added by setting `payAction`, never by reshaping the row; how a line gets paid is a `rail` value. PACKAGE_LEAF_NO_ENV — fetch is injected through FetchLike. USD_IS_DERIVED — `usd` is a normalized projection for columns and sums; native amounts stay exact.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: https://cognidao.org/knowledge/money-plane-snapshot-design
