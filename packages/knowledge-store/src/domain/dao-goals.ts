/**
 * Module: `@cogni/knowledge-store/domain/dao-goals`
 * Purpose: Selects the at-most-three approved DAO goals every AI loop reads.
 * Scope: Pure selection + shape (which rows count, the cap). Does not perform I/O; the SQL read lives in the Doltgres adapter's `listActiveGoals`.
 * Invariants:
 *   - ONE_GOAL_LIST: a goal is a merged row with `entry_type = 'goal'` whose id
 *     starts `goal-`, not deprecated. A goal is a human commitment, not a
 *     `hypothesis`: it is admin-merged and its confidence is never recomputed
 *     from citations. No new table — `entry_type` is plain text.
 *   - MAX_THREE_GOALS is a loud cap, never a blank: past the cap every active
 *     goal is still returned (sorted by id) and `goalCapOverflow` reports it;
 *     readers render/log the overflow. The list is never truncated or thrown
 *     away (a throw blanked the Goals section in every session).
 *   - NO_GOALS_FAILS_LOUD: zero goals is an empty array the caller must render
 *     visibly (the cognition bundle prints `no approved goals` plus the
 *     bootstrap instruction, `GOALS_BOOTSTRAP_INSTRUCTION`).
 *   - GOAL_RETIRED_BY_SUPERSEDES: a goal cited by a merged `supersedes` edge is
 *     inactive (DEPRECATE_NOT_DELETE; no contribution op sets `status`).
 *   - GOALS_RENDER_SHIPS_BY_RELEASE: `resolveGoals` + `renderGoalsLines` are the
 *     one cognition `## Goals` renderer every node calls; nodes keep only the
 *     call site (node-goals-bootstrap, story.5101).
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: https://cognidao.org/knowledge/dao-goals-design
